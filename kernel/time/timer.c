/*
 * The timer wheel has LVL_DEPTH array levels. Each level provides an array of
 * LVL_SIZE buckets. Each level is driven by its own clock and therefor each
 * level has a different granularity.
 *
 * The level granularity is:		LVL_CLK_DIV ^ lvl
 * The level clock frequency is:	HZ / (LVL_CLK_DIV ^ level)
 *
 * The array level of a newly armed timer depends on the relative expiry
 * time. The farther the expiry time is away the higher the array level and
 * therefor the granularity becomes.
 *
 * Contrary to the original timer wheel implementation, which aims for 'exact'
 * expiry of the timers, this implementation removes the need for recascading
 * the timers into the lower array levels. The previous 'classic' timer wheel
 * implementation of the kernel already violated the 'exact' expiry by adding
 * slack to the expiry time to provide batched expiration. The granularity
 * levels provide implicit batching.
 *
 * This is an optimization of the original timer wheel implementation for the
 * majority of the timer wheel use cases: timeouts. The vast majority of
 * timeout timers (networking, disk I/O ...) are canceled before expiry. If
 * the timeout expires it indicates that normal operation is disturbed, so it
 * does not matter much whether the timeout comes with a slight delay.
 *
 * The only exception to this are networking timers with a small expiry
 * time. They rely on the granularity. Those fit into the first wheel level,
 * which has HZ granularity.
 *
 * We don't have cascading anymore. timers with a expiry time above the
 * capacity of the last wheel level are force expired at the maximum timeout
 * value of the last wheel level. From data sampling we know that the maximum
 * value observed is 5 days (network connection tracking), so this should not
 * be an issue.
 *
 * The currently chosen array constants values are a good compromise between
 * array size and granularity.
 *
 * This results in the following granularity and range levels:
 *
 * HZ 1000 steps
 * Level Offset  Granularity            Range
 *  0      0         1 ms                0 ms -         63 ms

 * This function only differs from del_timer() on SMP: besides deactivating

 * CPUs.
 *
 * Synchronization rules: Callers must prevent restarting of the timer,
 * otherwise this function is meaningless. It must not be called from
 * interrupt contexts unless the timer is an irqsafe one. The caller must
 * not hold locks which would prevent completion of the timer's
 * handler. The timer's handler must not call add_timer_on(). Upon exit the
 * timer is not queued and the handler is not running on any CPU.
 *
 * Note: For !irqsafe timers, you must not hold locks that are held in
 *   interrupt context while calling this function. Even if the lock has
 *   nothing to do with the timer in question.  Here's why:
 *
 *    CPU0                             CPU1
 *    ----                             ----

 *  del_timer_sync(mytimer);
 *   while (base->running_timer == mytimer);
 *
 * Now del_timer_sync() will never return and never release somelock.
