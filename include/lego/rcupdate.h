 *
 * Assigns the specified value to the specified RCU-protected
 * pointer, ensuring that any concurrent RCU readers will see
 * any prior initialization.
 *
 * Inserts memory barriers on architectures that require them
 * (which is most of them), and also prevents the compiler from
 * reordering the code that initializes the structure after the pointer
 * assignment.  More importantly, this call documents which pointers
 * will be dereferenced by RCU read-side code.
 *
 * In some special cases, you may use RCU_INIT_POINTER() instead
 * of rcu_assign_pointer().  RCU_INIT_POINTER() is a bit faster due
 * to the fact that it does not constrain either the CPU or the compiler.
 * That said, using RCU_INIT_POINTER() when you should have used
 * rcu_assign_pointer() is a very bad thing that results in
 * impossible-to-diagnose memory corruption.  So please be careful.
 * See the RCU_INIT_POINTER() comment header for details.
 *
 * Note that rcu_assign_pointer() evaluates each of its arguments only
 * once, appearances notwithstanding.  One of the "extra" evaluations
 * is in typeof() and the other visible only to sparse (__CHECKER__),
 * neither of which actually execute the argument.  As with most cpp
 * macros, this execute-arguments-only-once property is important, so
 * please be careful when making changes to rcu_assign_pointer() and the
 * other macros that it invokes.

/**
 * rcu_dereference_check() - rcu_dereference with debug checking
 * @p: The pointer to read, prior to dereferencing
 * @c: The conditions under which the dereference will take place
 *
 * Do an rcu_dereference(), but check that the conditions under which the
 * dereference will take place are correct.  Typically the conditions
 * indicate the various locking conditions that should be held at that
 * point.  The check should return true if the conditions are satisfied.
 * An implicit check for being in an RCU read-side critical section
 * (rcu_read_lock()) is included.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 *	bar = rcu_dereference_check(foo->bar, lockdep_is_held(&foo->lock));
 *
 * could be used to indicate to lockdep that foo->bar may only be dereferenced
 * if either rcu_read_lock() is held, or that the lock required to replace
 * the bar struct at foo->bar is held.
 *
 * Note that the list of conditions may also include indications of when a lock
 * need not be held, for example during initialisation or destruction of the
 * target struct:
 *
 *	bar = rcu_dereference_check(foo->bar, lockdep_is_held(&foo->lock) ||
 *					      atomic_read(&foo->usage) == 0);
 *
 * Inserts memory barriers on architectures that require them
 * (currently only the Alpha), prevents the compiler from refetching
 * (and from merging fetches), and, more importantly, documents exactly
 * which pointers are protected by RCU and checks that the pointer is
 * annotated as __rcu.
