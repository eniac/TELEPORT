	stackslots_per_line=N
			stackslots_per_line=8
			stackslots_per_line=10

			Determing how many slots will be printed per line
			during kernel panic dump.
	stack_lines=N
			stack_lines=8
			stack_lines=10

			Determining how many lines are printed during
			kernel panic dump.

	earlyprintk=	[X86]
			earlyprintk=serial[,ttySn[,baudrate]]
			earlyprintk=serial[,0x...[,baudrate]]
			earlyprintk=ttySn[,baudrate]
			earlyprintk=dbgp[debugController#]
			earlyprintk=pciserial,bus:device.function[,baudrate]

			earlyprintk is useful when the kernel crashes before
			the normal console is initialized. It is not enabled by
			default because it has some cosmetic problems.

			Append ",keep" to not disable it when the real console
			takes over.

			Only one of vga, efi, serial, or usb debug port can
			be used at a time.

			Currently only ttyS0 and ttyS1 may be specified by
			name.  Other I/O ports may be explicitly specified
			on some architectures (x86 and arm at least) by
			replacing ttySn with an I/O port address, like this:
				earlyprintk=serial,0x1008,115200
			You can find the port for a given device in
			/proc/tty/driver/serial:
				2: uart:ST16650V2 port:00001008 irq:18 ...

			Interaction with the standard serial driver is not
			very good.

	apic=		[APIC] Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller
			Change the output verbosity whilst booting
			Format: { quiet (default) | verbose | debug }
			Change the amount of debugging information output
			when initialising the APIC and IO-APIC components.

	early_ioremap_debug
			[KNL]
			Enable to print early_ioremap() debug information.
			This may generate a mount of messages, you are warned.

	early_alternative_debug
			[X86]
			Enable to print alternative asssembly patching info.
			This is used to debug ALTERNATIVE() macro.

	smpboot_verbosity=debug
			[KNL, X86]
			Enable to print info from arch/x86/kernel/smpboot.c
			Used to debug booting secondary cpus.

	numa_zonelist_order= [KNL, BOOT] Select zonelist order for NUMA.
			one of ['zone', 'node', 'default'] can be specified
			By default, 64bit will node node order. 32bit will use zone order.

	memblock=debug	[KNL]
			Enable memblock debug messages. Enable this if you want
			to check the memblock allocation and the memory regions managed
			by our zoned page allocator.

	memmap=nn[KMG]@ss[KMG]
			[KNL] Force usage of a specific region of memory.
			Region of memory to be used is from ss to ss+nn.

	memmap=nn[KMG]#ss[KMG]
			[KNL,ACPI] Mark specific memory as ACPI data.
			Region of memory to be marked is from ss to ss+nn.

	memmap=nn[KMG]$ss[KMG]
			[KNL,ACPI] Mark specific memory as reserved.
			Region of memory to be reserved is from ss to ss+nn.
			Example: Exclude memory from 0x18690000-0x1869ffff
			         memmap=64K$0x18690000
			         or
			         memmap=0x10000$0x18690000

	memmap=nn[KMG]!ss[KMG]
			[KNL,X86] Mark specific memory as protected.
			Region of memory to be used, from ss to ss+nn.
			The memory region may be marked as e820 type 12 (0xc)
			and is NVDIMM or ADR memory.
